# Hash Algorithms For Go (Golang)
New powerfull hash algorithms for Golang.

## Features
- HWLDS (Hash with length-dependent security)
- High security against dictionary attacks
- Open Source

## HWLDS (Hash with length-dependent security)
Hash with time-dependent security is a suitable cryptographic method to prevent attacks based on word lists, and the cracker will need much more time to guess than other algorithms.
The longer the string, the more time it takes to hash. So the length of the entry will indicate its security.
